# CAM-KERAS


This is a further addition to "Distracted-Driver-Detection" project done in the fall semester's course of "Advance Predictive Modelling". Through this I am showcasing where in the image is our convolutional model is focusing on with respect to different classes and visualize it by highlighting those regions in the input image. Such a method is called is "Call Activation maps or Grad-CAM" in KERAS.
